# UK Pearson B1 Test Preparation Site
This is code for a website used to help prepare people to take the [Pearson Home B1 English test](https://www.pearsonpte.com/selt-tests/pte-home-b1) that is required in the naturalisation process. The website itself is available at [arastoof.github.io/b1Test](https://arastoof.github.io/b1Test)

There are essentially 2 parts to the site:
- **The Test Centre** - This is where the test can actually be taken. This has been made to emulate the way the test looks as closely as possible.

- **The Answer Reviewer** - This is where all of the answers to the questions being asked can be reviewed. Keep in mind that all answers are stored with indexedDB, so clearing browser history may result in a loss of answers.
